**#Anime List Project**

This project is a dynamic anime list that allows you to keep track of the anime you have watched. It provides filtering and search functionalities to easily find and organize your anime entries. The data for this project is retrieved from the MyAnimeList API.

**Note :** This is a test version of the project, and for demonstration purposes, the data has been obtained using the free Jikan API and stored in a JSON file.


##**Features**

List and display anime entries with relevant details such as title, episodes, synopsis, and more.
Filter the anime list based on different categories using the provided filter tools.
Search for specific anime titles using the search bar.
Click on an anime card to view detailed information in a popup.
Close the popup by clicking on the close button or outside the popup area.


##**Getting Started**

To launch the website, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The anime list will be displayed, and you can start exploring and interacting with the features.


##**Updating the Anime List**

If you want to modify or add new anime cards directly from the JSON file, you can use the provided Create_card.py script. This script generates anime cards based on the data from the JSON file.

Here's how to use the script:

Run the Create_card.py script.
The script will read the JSON file and generate the anime cards.
The generated cards will be automatically updated and saved to the file. You don't need to delete the file before running the script.

**Note :** Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and Python installed on your system before running the script.
